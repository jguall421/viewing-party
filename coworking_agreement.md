## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*
Mami: blacked - Mon 4:45pm- 8pm, Thu 7-9pm 
Both not availalbe: 5-7pm 
When we stuck for questions, make use of office hour

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

We plan to work together throughout the entirety of the project. For wave1 , we will meet on zoom and share screens to write the code/function. We will both individually think about writing code to come up with ideas then we will communicate and talk about our ideas.

For Wave 2, we will try to work independently on our own time and see what kind of logic we came up with on our own. Our Goal is to finish one wave for each day. By Wednesday we will have tests and should be attempting to debug. For Thursday we hope to clean up our waves and submit.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
Mami - I will take time reading to understand the instruction in full. By wednesday if we think we are behind, we may need to extend the due.
Jesica - gets discouraged when dependent on using Chat GPT or other AI tools. Utilizing Office Hours is very helpful when going through the initial thinking process. Communication is key and explaining each step is important rather than just getting it done.

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Mami - I prefer in meeting than just receiving writing so that I fully understand takeaways from long feedbacks.
Jesica - Open to feedback and should be communicated via zoom meeting rather than a slack message. Sometimes tone can come off different than thought text. I am always looking to improve as a programmer so constructive criticism is always welcome. Also maybe just getting to the point would be more helpful.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
One skill to improve as a team is to make sure we are pushing and pulling correctly without or the least amount of merge conflicts. This way we can get a better understanding and practice on how to work on project locally on our computers.
One team Communication Skill would be explaining the code or logic verbal for each function after we complete each wave.

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
